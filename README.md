# WORK EXPERIENCE

#### Livongo | Teladoc :: Staff Software Engineer :: Scala, SQL, Bash 

Feb 2017 - Present
Mountain View, CA

##### Accomplishments

 * Redesigned registration architecture for increased conversion and maintainability
 
   - Encoded registration flow as data, for increased visibility into user experience - paricularly when rendered to PDF
 
   - Encoded transformations as declarative data structure, for tracibility when implementing A/B testing and client-specific customizations
 
   - Reduced maintenance burden from mutiple tickets per week to 1-2 tickets per sprint
 
 * Built cli client for registration
 
   - Enabled scripting the registration experience, greatly improving bug reproducibility
 
   - Generated random valid answers enabled reproducing and debugging without tripping duplicate account checks
 
   - Rendering registration flows to PDF greatly eased communication with Product and Design teams
 
 * Designed and build tooling to ingest client data files using an ingestion specification
 
   - Normalized structure from CSV, Fixed Width, and XML files to a standard structure
 
   - Normalized and mapped fields from customer input formats to standard format
 
   - Reported errors with breadcrumbs to record and field in input file, regardless of input type
 
 * Designed and built ingestion pipeline for recruitable population
 
   - Provided unification of records from various files based on common identity critiera
 
   - Calculated eligiblity and inferred diagnoses to guide outreach
 
   - Gathered user data into a standard set of fields for use during outreach and registration
 
 * Refined and made generic a fuzzy matching library to increase registration conversion
 
   - Enabled skipping multiple steps during registration
 
   - Rule-based fuzzy matching allowed the creation of a batch version to close data gaps
 
   - Later leveraged to identify and prevent creation of duplicate accounts
